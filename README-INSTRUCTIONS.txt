# Resume Roaster - Complete Files

## What's in this folder:

1. **package.json** - Goes in the ROOT of your GitHub repository
2. **public/index.html** - Goes in a folder called "public"
3. **src/index.js** - Goes in a folder called "src"
4. **src/index.css** - Goes in a folder called "src"
5. **src/App.js** - Goes in a folder called "src"

## How to upload to GitHub:

### Option 1: Upload all at once (EASIEST)
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Delete the old "resume-roaster-v2.jsx" file (we don't need it anymore)
3. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
4. Drag ALL the files and folders from this download into GitHub
5. Click "Commit changes"

### Option 2: Create folders manually
1. In your GitHub repository, click "Add file" > "Create new file"
2. Type "public/index.html" in the filename box (this creates the folder)
3. Copy and paste the contents of public/index.html
4. Click "Commit"
5. Repeat for each file in the src folder
6. Upload package.json to the root

## After uploading:

Vercel will automatically detect the changes and try to deploy again. This time it should work because you'll have all the required files!
