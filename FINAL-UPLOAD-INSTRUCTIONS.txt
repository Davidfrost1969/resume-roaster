STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD TO GITHUB
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: DOWNLOAD THE ZIP FILE
   - Click on "resume-roaster-FINAL.zip" below
   - Save it to your computer
   - Extract/unzip it

STEP 2: GO TO YOUR GITHUB
   - Open: github.com/Davidfrost1969/resume-roaster
   
STEP 3: UPLOAD EVERYTHING
   - Click "Add file" button at top
   - Click "Upload files"
   - Drag EVERYTHING from the unzipped folder into GitHub
   - Make sure you see these folders uploading:
     * public (folder)
     * src (folder)  
     * All the other files in the root
   
STEP 4: COMMIT
   - Scroll down
   - Click the green "Commit changes" button
   
STEP 5: WAIT FOR VERCEL
   - Go to vercel.com
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - Look for SUCCESS ✓

IF IT WORKS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You'll see "Ready" or "Success" in Vercel with a green checkmark.
Click the domain link and your app will be LIVE!

Note: The app won't actually analyze resumes YET because you need to:
1. Get an Anthropic API key
2. Get a Google AdSense account  
3. Add those to the code

But it will BUILD and DEPLOY without errors!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
IF IT STILL FAILS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Take a screenshot of the Vercel error and send it to me.
But this SHOULD work because we have EVERYTHING now.

You've got this! This is the last time!
