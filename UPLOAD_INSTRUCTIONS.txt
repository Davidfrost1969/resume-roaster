RESUME ROASTER - GITHUB UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
============================================

You now have ALL the files your Resume Roaster app needs! Here's exactly what to do:

STEP 1: DOWNLOAD ALL FILES
---------------------------
Download all the files and folders from this chat. You should have:
- package.json
- tailwind.config.js
- postcss.config.js
- .gitignore
- README.md
- public/ folder (with index.html inside)
- src/ folder (with App.js, index.js, index.css, ResumeRoaster.jsx inside)

STEP 2: GO TO YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY
------------------------------------
1. Open your browser
2. Go to github.com/Davidfrost1969/resume-roaster
3. You'll see your current files (resume-roaster-v2.jsx, README, package.json)

STEP 3: DELETE OLD FILES (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
---------------------------------------------------
Since we're replacing everything with the correct structure:
1. Click on "resume-roaster-v2.jsx"
2. Click the trash icon to delete it
3. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

STEP 4: UPLOAD NEW FILES
-------------------------
1. Click the "Add file" button (near top of page)
2. Click "Upload files"
3. Drag ALL the files and folders you downloaded into the upload area
4. IMPORTANT: Make sure the folder structure is preserved:
   - public/index.html
   - src/App.js
   - src/index.js
   - src/index.css
   - src/ResumeRoaster.jsx
   - All the other files in the root
5. Scroll down and click the green "Commit changes" button

STEP 5: WAIT FOR VERCEL
------------------------
1. Go back to Vercel (vercel.com)
2. Vercel will automatically detect the changes
3. It will start building again
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Check if it says "Success" with a green checkmark!

WHAT IF IT STILL FAILS?
------------------------
If you see errors, take a screenshot and send it to me. But this should work now because we have:
✓ package.json with react-scripts
✓ public/index.html (the file it was looking for)
✓ Proper React app structure
✓ All dependencies listed

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT API KEY:
------------------------------
Before your app will actually WORK (analyze resumes), you'll need to:
1. Get an Anthropic API key from console.anthropic.com
2. Open src/ResumeRoaster.jsx
3. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual API key

But for now, let's just get it deployed without errors!

Good luck! Send me a screenshot when you're done or if you run into issues.
